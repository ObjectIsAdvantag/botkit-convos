# Heroku deployment of the 'convos' bot

This repo is an extract from the [Convos bot in the Botkit samples repo](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/botkit-webex-samples).

It is used to deploy the bot to Heroku, so that any Webex Teams user can experiment the code live by inviting `convos@sparkbot.io` join a Webex Teams space.

**If you're looking for guidance to deploy the bot, check the [Deploy a bot to Heroku](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/collab-cloud/spark-apps/collab-spark-bot-hosting/step/1) learning lab**
